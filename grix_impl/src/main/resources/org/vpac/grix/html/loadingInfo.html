      <h1>Fetching information about your VO membership(s) from the VO server(s)...
      </h1>

      <h2>This may take a while. Sometimes up to a minute, so please be patient.</h2>
      <p>Unfortunately, due to a bug in Grix ( or Java 5 - I could not not pinpoint it yet )
      sometimes Grix freezes after receiving the response from the VO server.</p>
      <p>
      So if you click for example one of the tabs on the top and nothing happens you'll have to kill Grix. If it happens
      regularly, please send the file grix.debug in the .globus folder of your home directory
      to markus@vpac.org and use Java 6. This newer version of Java works fine.
