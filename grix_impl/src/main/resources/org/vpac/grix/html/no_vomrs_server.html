<h1>Can not connect to this VOMRS server.</h1>

<p>This can have several reasons:</p>
<ul>
<li>This machine either does not have a network connection.</li><br>
<li>This machine has got a network connection but the neccessary port to connect to the VOMRS server is blocked by a firewall.</li><br>
<li><b>
Most likely though, this error only means that the VO you are trying to contact does not 
provide a VOMRS server but chances are that it provides a VOMS server.</b></p>
<p>Because of this, Grix can't help you requesting membership (and manage this membership once
you are a member) for this VO. You can do it via the VO's webinterface, though. Click the
URL on the bottom and subscribe for the VO. If you can't connect to the site you probably did not load
your certificate into your browser.
