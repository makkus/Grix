	   <h1>Virtual Organisations</h1>
	   <p>
		   On the right-hand side you can see a list of all Virtual Organisations (VOs)
		   Grix is trying to contact. If the connection fails (which can happen because of
		   several different reasons) you will see a message stating that. Contact a 
		   local administrator if you think something is wrong or if you need to access
		   this VO.
       </p>
       <p>
       		A virtual organisation is a group of projects (or groups) which are managed 
			on the same VO server. For example, the APACGrid in Australia has got one
			VO server for all projects/groups that want to run jobs there. Other grids have got
			one VO server for every project because they have got very big projects.
  	   </p>
  	   <p>
  	   		As you see this page, you obviously requested membership on a VO server
  	   		successfully already. Depending on the setup of the server, this membership
  	   		may not be enough for you to access grid services. For example within the 
  	   		APACGrid you have to request membership for a group that is hosted on the
  	   		VO server. To do so, just select the group you want to be member in on the bottom
  	   		combo box and click the "Apply" button. Once the group administrator has approved/denied
  	   		your request you'll receive an email. Restart Grix or click the "Refresh" button on the right
  	   		and Grix will display your new status.
  	   	</p>
  	   	<p>
  	   		If everything went right you can create a proxy just by ticking the "Include VOMS Attribute Certificate"
  	   		box and selecting the appropriate group	selected in the combo box of either the local proxy or MyProxy tab.
