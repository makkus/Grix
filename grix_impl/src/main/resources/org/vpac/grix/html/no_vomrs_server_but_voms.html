<h1>This VO only provides a VOMS server...</h1>
<p>...not a VOMRS server on top of it.</p>
<p>This means that Grix could not help you request membership for this VO. Also, Grix can't
show you detailed information about your membership once you are a member.</p>
<p>But, since you see this page, Grix detected that you are already a member of this VO
and therefor you can create voms proxies for this VO.</p>
<p>You can manager your membership in this VO through the VO's webinterface (remember that you need
your certificate loaded into your browser):</p>
