	   <h1>MyProxy credentials</h1>
	   <p>
			One of the big no-no's in the X509 domain is sending the private (encrypted or unencrypted) 
			over the network. When using the grid, there are situations that require you to delegate 
			your credentials to a remote machine so that this machine is able to execute a task 
			in your name. For example, if you use one of our portals you would log in the portal, 
			prepare your job by uploading required files and adjusting parameters and so on. 
			When it comes to submitting this job the portal would need your credentials to be
			able to identify as you to the APACGrid gateway it chooses to submit your job to. 
			Because you are not allowed to transfer your private key to the portal we implemented 
			the use of proxies within the APACGrid. 
   		</p>
   		<p>
   		In short it works like this: 
   		<ol>
   		<li>On the machine you are working on (e.g. at home) you contact the so called MyProxy server, 
   		authenticate and instruct the server to create a set of short-living 
   		(as long as you think your job will run) credentials which is called a "proxy". 
   		You also provide a username and password to access this proxy. 
   		This works without transfering your private key.</li>
   		<li>When logging in to the portal you provide the above username and password.</li>
   		<li>The portal uses this information to get the proxy from the MyProxy server and, when it wants 
   		to submit a job on your behalf, submits the proxy along with the job to the APACGrid gateway.</li>
   		<li>The gateway accepts the proxy, knows which identity the job is mapped to and runs the job.</li>
   		</ol>
   		Of course, it is a bit more complicated in detail but that's all you need to know to understand the workflow you will face if you submit your first job through a portal.
