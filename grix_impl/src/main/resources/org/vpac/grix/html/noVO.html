<h1>No Virtual Organisation configured</h1>

<p>Grix can't find information about a VO server. You need so called "vomses"-files
in the folder ".glite/vomses" in your home directory.
</p>
<p>Every vomses file has got one line in it. As an example, here is the content of
the vomses file of the APACGrid VO server.</p>
<p><code>"APACGrid" "vomrs.apac.edu.au" "15001" "/C=AU/O=APACGrid/OU=APAC/CN=vomrs.apac.edu.au" "APACGrid"
</code></p><p>Also, have a look in the folder ".glite/vomses_available" in your home directory. 
There should be preconfigured vomses files in there. Just copy the ones you need into the ".glite/vomses"
folder.</p>
<p>If you need more information about the settings for your projects VO server, contact
your local administrator or the administrator of the project.
